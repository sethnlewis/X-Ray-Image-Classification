## Conclusion




## Further Investigation
This investigation leaves several aspects of the analysis underdeveloped, leaving space for expanded future analysis. 

- Extensive grid-based hyperparameter tuning

- Testing generic pre-defined neural networks

- Increasing resolution of images. Currently they are downsampled substantially to prevent RAM issues.
